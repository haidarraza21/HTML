    <h4>About LMS</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>The SGVU Learning Management System (LMS) is a flexible learning management solution. <br> In LMS faculties, can create and deliver online courses to help their students to achieve their learning goals. <br>

        We have included a new feature in our LMS for online conferencing (SEEKHO). <br> This new feature includes real-time sharing of audio, video, presentation, and screen – along with collaboration tools such as whiteboard, shared notes, polling, and breakout rooms. SEEKHO can also record all your sessions for later playback. <br>
        
        SEEKHO extends these core features to enable a faculty to engage students for learning. For example, a faculty can use SEEKHO’s multi-user whiteboard to help a student with solving a difficult math problem.</p>
